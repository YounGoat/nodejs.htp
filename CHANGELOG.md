Notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/).

##	[0.12.0] - Dec 18th, 2018

*	Support proxy!

##	[0.11.0] - Nov 19th, 2018

*	Fixed the bug trying gunzip a HEAD response.

##	[0.10.3] - Aug 7th, 2018

*	An instance of DnsAgent may be passed in via `htp({ dnsAgent })` to create a customised http user agent.
*	Fixed the bug that dnsAgent and http(s)Agent unnecessarily created when no special settings property passed in.

##	[0.10.2] - Aug 5th, 2018

*	Add mothod __COPY__ to the `method-without-payload` list.
*	Allow all methods to request with payload as long as no arguments omitted. E.g.
	```javascript
	// An OVERLOAD2.UnmatchingException will be thrown before.
	// However, no exception thrown now.
	htp.delete('http://example.com/source.html', null, { Backup: '/target.html' });
	```

##	[0.10.1] - Aug 3rd, 2018

*	Fixed the bug that the package depends on itself.

##	[0.10.0] - Aug 1st, 2018

*	Fixed the bug that when `performance` data sometimes incomplete when passed-in agent enables `keepAlive` option:
	```javascript
	// Event `connect` will be not triggered when `socket` is re-used and already connected.
	socket.once('connect', function() {
		timeout.end('CONNECT');
		emitOnBodyStream('connect');
		
		timeout.start('RESPONSE', fnDone);
		timeout.start('DATA', fnDone);
		Object.assign(connection, object2.clone(socket, [ /^remote/, /^local/ ]));
	});
	```

*	Fixed the bug that customised settings `keepAlive` not effective.
*	Change default settings `keepAlive` to `true`.

##	[0.9.0] - June 19th, 2018

*	Accept all instance of `stream` rather than only those of `stream.Readable` as body.
*	Support charset 'ISO-8859-1' on parsing response body.
*	Delete items with undefined value from `headers`. Otherwise, an Error will be thrown when http/https try to setHeader with undefined value.

##	[0.8.2] - May 10th, 2018

*	Catch error on processing response encoded via gzip/deflate.

##	[0.8.1] - May 9th, 2018

*	Fixed the bug that dependencies missed.

##	[0.8.0] - Apr 24th, 2018

*	Default [settings](./settings.js) changed on `response.timeout` and `data.timeout`.

##	[0.7.1] - April 1st, 2018

*	Fixed the bug that on response with unsupported charset, an unhandled exception will be thrown.

##	[0.7.0] - Mar 23rd, 2018 - RISKY

*	`http.request()` or `https.request()` is wrapped with `try ... catch ...`.
*	Standlone instances of `http.Agent` and `https.Agent` are used in replacement of `http.globalAgent` and `https.globalAgent`.
*	Default setting `dns_ttl` is changed to *60* (in seconds) from *600000* (in milli-seconds). And the unit of __options.dns_ttl__ is changed to seconds.

##	[0.6.1] - Feb 7th, 2018 - RISKY

### Changed, RISKY

*	When instance of `stream.Readable` used as HTTP body, errors on the stream will be caught and the request action will be ceased forcely.

##	[0.6.0] - Feb 1st, 2018

###	New

*	Property `beforeCallback` added to `options` argument in `new SimpleAgent(options)`.

##	[0.5.1] - Jan 16, 2018

##	Changed, RISKY

*	In this version, hostname in the URL will be replaced with IP address returned by __dns-agent__ before being passed to `http.request()` or `https.request()` to avoid repetitive DNS requests for resolving the same hostname.  
	在这个版本中，我们用 __dns-agent__ 返回的 IP 地址替换 URL 中的主机名，然后才将其传递至 `http.request()` 或 `https.request()` 方法。__dns-agent__ 本身具备可靠的及可调节的缓存功能，如果针对同一主机名的 URL 地址，发生高并发调用或短时间内的大量调用，这一作法可以有效避免系统重复发起 DNS 解析。

##	[0.5.0] - Jan 8, 2018

##	Fixed, IMPORTANT

*	Fixed the bug that when invoking methods with payload (e.g. POST and PUT) of instanceof of __htp/SimpleAgent__, body of falsed value 0-length string will be ignored.
*	Force the clientRequest to abort and the incommingMessage (response) to destroy on error ocurring.  
	此前，当错误发生后，请求和响应可能并未终止，由此可能导致不可预知的问题。

##	[0.4.2] - Jan 2, 2018

*	On *piping* mode, pass *address* object to listener of event *dns*.

##	[0.4.1] - Jan 2, 2018

###	Fixed

*	Fixed the bug that, on *piping* mode, event *dns* is missed if hostname has been resolved and cached before.
*	Fixed the bug that, on *piping* mode, event *error* is missed.

##	[0.4.0] - Dec 13, 2017

*	[dns-agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dns-agent) is depended while __htp__ is resolving domain names.

##	[0.3.0] - Dec 8, 2017

*	Setting *rejectUnauthorized* added.

##	[0.2.0]

###	New

*	Byeond *basic* and *piping* mode, new *pipingOnly* mode is offered.
*	Returned stream in *piping* mode will emit events and may be catched via `on(<eventName>, ...)` method.
*	[README in Simplifed Chinese language](./README.zh_CN.md).

###	Fixed

*	In previous version, `htp/SimpleAgent` will invoke `callback()` (if passed) twice if there is some exception throwed in `callback()` itself.

###	What is difference between *piping* and *pipingOnly* ?

In *piping* mode, you may get data via piping to a writable stream, or reading `response.body` and `response.bodyBuffer` directly in function `callback(err, response)` which is passed as the last argument.

##	[0.1.1] - Nov 23, 2017

###	Fixed

*	In previous versions, __htp__ cannot recognized some key fields in response headers if their names are not lowercased. 

##	[0.1.0] - 2017-11-12

###	Milestone

Now， __htp__ is streamable. E.g.  
```javascript
htp.piping.get('http://www.example.com/').pipe(fs.createWriteStream('index.html'));
```

##	[0.0.5] - 2017-11

__htp/sSimpleAgent__ added.

##	[0.0.4] - 2017-10

Add new *action* property to Errors throwed. Value of the property is made up of the method name and the url joined with a whitespace, e.g.
```javascript
htp.get('http://www.example.com/', function(err, response) {
	if (err) {
		err.action == 'GET http://www.example.com/'; // true
	}
});
```

##  [0.0.3] - 2017-09

No promise created or returned when callback() functions offered.

##	[0.0.2] - 2017-07, https

HTTPS requests are supported.

##	[0.0.1] - 2017-07

Released.
